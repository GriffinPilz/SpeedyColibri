# colibrì → Rust port status (SpeedyColibri)

This repository is being converted from the original C engine (`c/`) to Rust.
The Rust workspace lives at the repo root (`Cargo.toml` + `crates/`); the C
sources stay in the tree as the reference implementation until each module is
fully ported and validated.

**Goal:** a full 1:1 rewrite of the whole engine (CPU forward pass, kernels,
grammar, tokenizer, backends, tools) that runs GLM-5.2 token-exact against the
same model files.

**Deployment target:** a Docker container on **NVIDIA DGX Spark** (GB10 Grace
Blackwell, aarch64 + CUDA), single node first, designed to split across nodes
**expert-parallel** over an RDMA/RoCE link. Backend priority is **CUDA → CPU
(Grace/aarch64 NEON)**; Apple-Silicon Metal is off the critical path. See
[DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md).

**Approach:** bottom-up. Leaf modules first (no dependencies, easy to validate),
then the forward pass, then the GPU backends and tooling. Every ported module
ships with unit tests; the C code is the oracle.

¹ `colibri-safetensors` omits the `posix_fadvise(DONTNEED)` + `O_DIRECT` twin-fd
behavior for now (performance/RSS, not correctness). Reintroduce via
`libc::posix_fadvise` behind a `cfg(unix)` gate.

## Milestone order

1. **Foundation (done):** json, config, dtypes, quant container, tier eviction,
   safetensors, tokenizer, sampling. All tested.
2. **Kernels:** ✅ **aarch64 NEON** `dot_i4_f32` / `dot_i8_f32` (two-accumulator
   `vfmaq`/`vaddvq`, mirroring the C `matmul_i4`/`matmul_q`) wired into
   `matmul_qt` — **5.4× over scalar** at n=6144 (17.2 vs 3.2 GFLOP/s), byte-exact
   with the scalar reference, harness still passes. The f32 path stays scalar
   (byte-exact with the C f32 kernel). ⬜ pending: int2 NEON, the IDOT
   int8-activation dot (`dot_i8i8`), and an x86 AVX2 path for dev boxes.
3. **CPU forward pass (`colibri-engine`):**
   - ✅ primitives: RMSNorm/LayerNorm, interleaved-partial RoPE, `matmul_qt`
     (exact scalar for f32/int8/int4/int2), `embed_row`, weight quantizers, and
     the `qt_from_disk` weight loader — all unit-tested
   - ✅ weight-loader driver (`load_model`): materializes embed/lm_head/final_norm
     + per-layer attention & dense-MLP / shared-expert / router by GLM tensor name,
     detects DSA/MTP; tested end-to-end on a synthetic tiny model. (Expert LRU
     sizing still ⬜ — experts stream at forward time.)
   - ✅ MLA attention (`attention.rs`) with compressed KV-cache (`KvCache`) — both
     the reconstruction reference and the DeepSeek weight-absorption decode core;
     tested that the two agree, and that batched prefill == step-by-step decode.
     (DSA sparse-indexer top-k selection still ⬜ — this is the dense path.)
   - ✅ MoE block (`moe.rs`): sigmoid router + bias top-K (noaux_tc), SwiGLU
     experts, shared expert; experts streamed via an `ExpertProvider` whose
     `ShardsExpertProvider` checks `colibri-cluster` ownership (single-node local
     now, RDMA-remote later). Router/FFN/shared tested independently.
   - ✅ resident expert cache (`cache.rs`): `ExpertCache` keeps loaded experts in
     RAM (returns `Arc<Expert>`), LFRU eviction (`colibri-core::tier`) only when
     over a byte budget, optional pinned hot-store; hit/miss/eviction stats.
     `coli gen` shows e.g. `32 hits / 2 misses` across decode.
   - ✅ pinned hot-store warm-up / AUTOPIN (`usage.rs` + `cache.warm_pin`): a
     persistent `.coli_usage` history (C-compatible `layer eid count` format,
     `UsageHistory`) is loaded at startup and the globally-hottest experts are
     pinned resident (`COLI_PIN_GB` budget); the session's selections are merged
     back and saved. Port of `usage_load`/`usage_save`/`pin_load`.
   - ✅ parallel expert preload (`preload.rs`): `preload_parallel` reads experts
     **directly from the original safetensors** across `num_cores` threads (no
     repack, no second copy) — sorted by on-disk offset, contiguous chunk per
     thread, per-thread byte budget → resident `PreloadStore`, zero per-token disk
     I/O. `COLI_PRELOAD=1 coli gen` uses it. Optional `coli repack` still exists
     (writes core-sharded blobs + a `Manifest` for max sequentiality;
     `COLI_PRELOAD=<dir>` uses those). Both tested byte-identical to the disk path
     incl. generation output.
   - ✅ capacity/KV planning (`capacity` module + `coli capacity <snap> [ram] [ctx]`):
     18 MB/expert int4; KV = 175.5 KB/token (compressed MLA, 78 layers) so 256K
     ctx ≈ 44 GB KV. One 128 GB Spark: ~3,980 experts at 256K ctx (~6,000 at ≤47K).
     (CACHE_ROUTE/top-p routing variants ⬜.)
   - ✅ per-layer forward (`forward.rs`): in_ln → MLA attention → residual →
     post_ln → MoE/dense → residual, then final norm + lm_head; greedy decode
     loop (`generate_greedy`). Runs end-to-end on a synthetic model with routed
     experts (integration test + `coli gen`); deterministic. **The CPU forward
     pass generates.** Next: wire a tokenizer into `coli chat`, then perf (SIMD,
     expert LRU cache) and the deferred pieces (DSA, speculation, CUDA).
4. **CUDA (Blackwell) backend:** primary GPU tier for DGX Spark.
   - ✅ FFI binding (`colibri-backend/src/cuda.rs` + `build.rs`): compiles
     `c/backend_cuda.cu` with nvcc (`--features cuda`, `CUDA_ARCH=native`/`sm_121`),
     links `cudart`+`stdc++`; safe wrappers for init/mem_info/tensor_upload/matmul/
     expert_mlp/lifecycle; `CudaBackend::probe()` (init-based); `coli backend`.
     **GPU-VERIFIED on a DGX Spark** (GB10, sm_121, CUDA 13.0): builds+links, inits
     the GPU (130.7 GB VRAM), and a GPU matmul smoke test (`cargo test -p
     colibri-backend --features cuda`) passes. build.rs skips nvcc gracefully on
     non-CUDA hosts.
   - ⬜ wire into the forward pass: upload resident dense + hot experts on load,
     route `matmul_qt` / expert FFN to the GPU with CPU fallback; validate on
     hardware against the C-vs-Rust harness. Then port kernels from FFI to Rust.
   (Metal is deprioritized — not a deployment target.)
5. **Speculative + grammar:** MTP head, grammar-forced drafts, GBNF engine,
   schema→GBNF.
6. **Persistence & serving:** KV-cache `.coli_kv`, `.coli_usage` learning cache,
   OpenAI-compatible server, web dashboard.
7. **Multi-node (expert-parallel):** real `num_nodes > 1` sharding + RDMA/RoCE
   transport over ConnectX-7 (GPUDirect); split-model on-disk layout per node.
8. **Second model:** `olmoe.c`.

## Validation strategy

- Unit tests per crate (the C behavior is the spec). 87 tests currently pass.
- **C-vs-Rust harness (`scripts/validate_c_vs_rust.py`, see [VALIDATION.md](VALIDATION.md)):**
  runs both engines on the same tiny synthetic model (real GLM architecture, no
  torch / no 370 GB model) and diffs greedy generation + teacher-forcing at f32
  and int4. **Currently PASSES** — byte-exact at f32, token-exact at int4, on
  both modes. The C engine is forced onto the exact CPU path
  (`IDOT=0 ABSORB=0 DRAFT=0`). Since the C engine is itself token-exact vs a
  `transformers` oracle, this transitively validates the Rust dense path.
- Not yet covered by the harness: DSA indexer, MTP speculation, CUDA (unported).

## Notes

- `scripts/gen_unicode.py` regenerates `crates/colibri-tokenizer/src/unicode_tables.rs`
  from `c/tok_unicode.h` — do not hand-edit the generated file.
- Clippy style-lints (e.g. `needless_range_loop`) are deferred where the Rust
  deliberately mirrors a C index loop; they do not affect correctness.
- Comments in `c/glm.c` are mixed Italian/English (upstream); ported comments
  are in English.
